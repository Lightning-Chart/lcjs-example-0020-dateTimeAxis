# JavaScript Chart with DateTime Axis

![JavaScript Chart with DateTime Axis](dateTimeAxis-darkGold.png)

This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

-   Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
-   Open the project folder in a terminal:

          npm install              # fetches dependencies
          npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

-   The application is available at _http://localhost:8080_ in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

This example shows creation of a DateTime Axis, for rendering XY-series where either/both of X/Y dimensions can present _time_. This doesn't affect the input of data - format remains as _{x: number, y: number}_ - however, DateTime-axes format their values from number to a date and time. This affects axis labels, markers and cursors.

A DateTime-_Axis_ is created by specifying its _TickStrategy_. Here's how it looks when setting the _Axis TickStrategy_:

```javascript
// Add an XY Chart
const chart = lightningChart().ChartXY({})
// Set the TickStrategy of the default X Axis to a DateTime TickStrategy
chart.getDefaultAxisX().setTickStrategy(AxisTickStrategies.DateTime)
```

The above mentioned examples will provide an Axis that will format its scale values to their DateTime-representations.
